# geneticTSP
A genetic algorithms approach to solve the travel salesman problem

## Case studies
### Djibouti (38 cities)

Source: <http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/djtour.html>

* Best result using GA: 6659.431532931466 (25 generations, kept until generation 120, then stopped)
* Optimal result: 6656
* Error: 0.05 %

Note: the difference in the result can be caused by numerical errors (In the TSPLIB norm, the travel cost between each pair of cities is the Euclidean distance between the points rounded to the nearest integer (not the distance rounded to two decimal places according to <https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/56597/tsp-problem-with-a-benchmark-data>).
